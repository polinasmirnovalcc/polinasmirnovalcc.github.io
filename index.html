				<p><strong>LCC International University</strong> is an American Liberal Arts school which is located in
					the heart of Europe. Last year I started my education at this wonderful place. My freshman year was
					amazing! First of all, I moved to a foreign country. It is an interesting experience for me since I
					became independent and responsible for my life. Secondly, I started studying at LCC. Education here
					is very interesting, moreover, it provides students with many opportunities for the future. Thirdly,
					I have met so many incredible people from all over the world. LCC has a great strong community so I
					can say that I am blessed to be surrounded by these people!</p>

				<p>At the beginning of the first semester of my sophomore year, we had a trip to Kaunas. Since my cousin
					entered LCC this year, we were there together. <strong>Kaunas is a beautiful old Lithuanian city
						with a very long history.</strong> My friends and I visited many historical places: museums,
					castles, cathedrals. After all, we were walking in the center of Kaunas, in the old town. There were
					many incredible locations to take photographs. Travelling is an important part of my life. I enjoy
					visiting new places, meeting new people and share culture and experience with them.</p>
